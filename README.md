# Computational Thinking_Assignment 1 (5 credits)

This repository contains the first Computational Thinking Assignment (March 2019).

The primary document is the Jupyter Notebook "Computational Thinking_Assignment 1.ipynb".

To run this document you must have installed software to run python code (https://www.python.org/), for example the Anaconda package (https://www.anaconda.com/).

By running each cell in succession, it will generate a dataframe of randomly generated numbers that are somewhat reflective of real life real estate sales data. 

The dataset connected with this jupyter notebook is saved in this GitHUB Repository.
